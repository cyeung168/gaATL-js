####What is Javascript?

In short, JavaScript was a language built to support Netscape Navigator browser. It quickly became adopted by many other graphical web broswers as a standard to build interactive web applications. Javascript and ECMAScript are interchangably used to refer to the same language. 

While Javascript has it shortcomings for being too liberal making it difficult to identify problems in the code, it's weakness also becomes its advantage by allowing space for techniques that are impossible in more rigid languages. Such as the permittance of the language being used for more than client-facing interactions within the browser, Javascript also lends itself to outside of the broswer through programs like Node.js

**How does Javascript work in the browser?**

* **HTML**: Structure - What does it mean?
* **CSS**: Presentation – What does it look like?
* **JavaScript**: Behavior – What does it do?

Javascript is used to manage interaction on a web page, alongside HTML and CSS. 


**How can Javascript be used?**

1. **Front-End Development** : Development of client-side code that is specific to what the user sees and interacts with.

2. **Back-End Development** : Development of server-side code that handles functions like routing, data handling and databases. The behind the scene code magic that makes apps work

**Web Development** : Building sites and applications for the web

####Computational Thinking (CT)
> ... bridging the communication gap between us,(humans) ... and computers ... The first is to appeal to our sense of physical world and build interfaces that mimic that world and allow us to manipulate shapes on a screen with our fingers ... For open-ended interfaces, such as instructing the computer to perform arbitrary tasks, we've had more luck with an approach that makes use of our talent for language: teaching the machine a language.

Integration of human thinking with the capabilities of computers (ie. pseudocode)

	• Formulating problems ways that enable use of computers & other tools to solve
		• Logically organizing & analyzing data
	• Representing data through abstractions such as models and simulations
	• Automating solutions through algorithmic thinking (a series of ordered steps)		• Identifying, analyzing, and implementing possible solutions with the goal of achieving the most efficient and effective combination of steps and resources		• Generalizing and transferring this problem solving process to a wide variety of problems

*Domain name is an easier way/short name for users to remember an IP address. The domain name serves as a link to an IP address. It points to a place where the information lives on the IP address.*
